**Bootstrap causal mediation**
Looking at the output it is clear that P<.05 for ACME( Average Causation Mediation Indirect effect) and ADE( Average Direct Effect ), thus signifying that IV actually affects DV and thus the mediator variable is considered to be responsible for partial mediation of the DV.
