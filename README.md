P-value is much less than 0.05, hence forth we reject the Null hypothesis and conclude that the Political stance of the respondent is related on figuring out the presence of racial discrimination in US.

**Ads were made on Republican’s( Conservative ) like George W.Bush and Donald J Trump calling them as racist at several occasions. So, itseems like where there is “No Racism” there actually is “Racism”.**

**Bootstrap causal mediation**
Looking at the output it is clear that P<.05 for ACME( Average Causation Mediation Indirect effect) and ADE( Average Direct Effect ), thus signifying that IV actually affects DV and thus the mediator variable is considered to be responsible for partial mediation of the DV. Meaning that, just like the degree(IV), the race(Mediator) of the respondent too had its fair share in determining the job loss(DV).
